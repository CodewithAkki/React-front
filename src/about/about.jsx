          <h3> Role of National Working Group </h3><div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government of India (the Ministry of Human Resource Development) also constituted a National Working Group to look into the role of AICTE in the context of proliferation of technical institutions, maintenance of standards, and other related matters. The Working Group recommended that AICTE be vested with the necessary statutory authority for making it more effective, which would consequently require restructuring and strengthening with the necessary infrastructure and operating mechanisms.</p></div>
